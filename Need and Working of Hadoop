Need of Hadoop:
Hadoop is needed to overcome the challenges of big data that are-
storage 
processing
Hadoop is an open source platform that provides excellent data management provision.
It is a framework that supports the processing of large data setsin a distributing compuiting environment.
It is designed to expand from single servers to thousands of machines each providing computation and storage. 


Working of hadoop
With hdfs the data is written once on the server and subsequently read and re-used many times.
And MapReduce mainly works as breaking down the data into smaller manageable pieces and then processing the data in parallel
on the distributed cluster and then combine the result.
